AtliQ Hardware is recently facing issues with improper sales data received through analysts. Sales directors often sugar coat valuable sales insights and the management is unable to get a clear picture even if sales are declining. Hence, there is a need for an automated dashboard that can be accessed directly by the management stakeholders and thereby decision will be data and analysis driven.
